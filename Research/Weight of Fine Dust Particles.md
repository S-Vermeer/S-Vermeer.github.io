{ WHY IS IT DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT }
{ Varies a lot based on what type of fine dust it is }
{ Usually primarily one type of element, ex Si-based, Ca-based etc }
{ Depends on the weight of that element }
{ Chemical reactions, especially in smaller particles can change the weight of these atoms }
{ There are a variety of ways to measure it all, for example with vanderwaals forces or changes in frequency }
{ These particles aren't exactly a sphere so not even the radius can be said exactly }
{ It also depends on how 'nauwkeurig' the measurements are }
{ Elemental compositions are complex, contain elements from the organic and inorganic phase }

{ WHY IS IT A PROBLEM FOR US }
{ Our scope is Eindhoven, but it also concerns multiple inner scopes that are being researched, namely airport, traffic and agriculture. }
{ The sensors know the amount, and do a calculation for the wait and calibrate it, with XXXXX as the formula, but we don't know which values are used in that formula so we cant deduce it from that }
{ The goal of this project is to depict a zoomed in version of the amount of fine dust particles in that area. The API gives us values in ug/m3, but seeing as we don't know what the particles weigh (approximately) we dont know at all how much particles we should visualize / how much we should zoom in. For example if 1ug/m3 is a million particles, than we should zoom in to a more manageble ratio such as cm3. }
