# CDT A(I)R Zoom Lens - Documentation 
  
## Description  
### Background  
This project is part of the City Digital Twin project, which was created to enrich open data (air quality) with public area info and other data sources, to define useful eco-score.  
  
#### Fine Dust  
This project will be concerning fine dust. Fine dust is a mixture of particles < 10 Âµm (0.01 mm) from various sources. Fine dust is harmful to the health of people. This is because its chemical and physical properties produce oxidative stress on mitochondria, DNA and proteins. It can also cause systemic inflammatory reactions. It also has been connected with cardiovascular disease and some cancers.  
  
For more information, look at the research documentation in [the research document](https://git.fhict.nl/I428513/cdt-a-i-r-zoom-lens-documentation/-/blob/main/Documents/Research%20Document.md).  
  
### Concept  
For this project we will be using Augmented Reality to visualize the fine dust particles so they are more tangible to the inhabitants of Eindhoven.  We will also be using Artificial Intelligence to predict the behaviour of fine dust.
  
#### Current Features  
We currently have already researched/documented a few things:
