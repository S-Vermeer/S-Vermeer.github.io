# 1.   AR zoomlens

One of the biggest problems with the most wicked city problems like air pollution or biodiversity loss, is that people are not aware of their seriousness. To make this more tangible, let’s create an AR app that “zooms in” the air or the soil to a microscopic level.

**Proposal**: based on the air quality real-time location-based data, generate an AR picture or simple animation of how the air might look like if seen under a powerful microscope. Represent accurately the density and size of each particle type. Completely clean air should be transparent (?).
