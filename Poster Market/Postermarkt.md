Visually attractive, informative poster about your project(s). Each project needs its own poster.
There will be a vote for the best poster, and a small prize.
Take into consideration that it is an interactive event, so you can use it to bring up discussion points, test proof of concepts or have attendants fill in questionnaires.

Dear students,

As you have been informed of already, there is going to be a poster event at the 27th of March. It is mandatory to join this event, and you are required to create a poster that includes the following requirements.

The requirements of the poster are as follows:
- The poster needs to be of size A1, which can be printed at TQ5-2. Ask the ISSD for help if you don't know how. 
- The poster needs to be visually attractive and informative about the project.
- You need to make a poster for each project.

Some additional tips and important information:
- Make sure your poster is printed before the 27th, in case of technical issues and time constraints.
- There will be a vote on the best poster, so put in some effort to win a prize.
- The event is interactive, so think about possible discussion points, have proof of concepts ready for testing or have questionnaires for attendees to fill in, etc...

We look forward to seeing what great things you have been working on and may the best poster win!

Kind regards,
Organization Poster Event
