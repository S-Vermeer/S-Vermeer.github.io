## Why is it interesting
One of the biggest problems with the most wicked city problems is that people are not aware of their seriousness. One of these city problems is fine dust.

### What is it
Fine dust is a mixture of particles that are smaller than 0.01mm.

### Where does it come from
It can come from a lot of things, but road traffic and construction areas are the main sources in the area. This is also increasing due to urban growth.

### Why is it a problem
Fine dust is harmful to the health of people. For example, when it passes through your body or when you breathe it in, it doesn't dissolve in fluid. It irritates your organs and causes infections and calcification in your veins.

### What can I do about it
Don't smoke, wear a mask when renovating your house, improve your ventilation, change your route to reduce exposure.

## Approach
Problem Definition -> Research and Experiment -> GO/NO GO -> Component Development (Iterate) -> Combined Development -> Finalize

(Add smaller steps... or AR with click on phase)

## Results
### Predicted
AR application that takes your location and visualizes the fine dust at that location, in the past, present and future.
