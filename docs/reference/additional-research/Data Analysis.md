### 3.1 What data is available regarding this problem?
Eindhoven location-based data visualization is a requirement from the stakeholder, however to know what we are visualizing we need to do some *Data Analytics*.

### 3.2 How can AI be used to make predictions using this data?
As this project is done in the context of an AI internship, artificial intelligence is also an important aspect. To see which AI will be created, some *Data Analytics* is needed and based on that a Prototype will be created. After testing that prototype we can see whether the predictions have the desired effect.
