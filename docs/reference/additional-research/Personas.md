The initial personas are based on the visions of the stakeholder and the observations from the expert. 

The goal of the stakeholder is that anyone in Eindhoven can become aware of the fine dust in their current environment, to be aware that it exists and how it behaves. 

The expert has said that 50% of the impact of fine dust is due to our own lifestyle choices such as smoking, construction indoors and poor ventilation. Things people can do about this is to look at their mobility, for example choosing a different route to prevent exposure or by not going out when the fine dust is very prominent. A fetus can develop learning disorders such as ADHD or dyslexia when ultra fine dust particles crash into their developing brain. They also mentioned that we should look at people with lung problems that might not be able to go outside if the fine dust concentration is high. He also mentioned something about a group of people in an appartment complex who thought they were affected by the fine dust after the trees were cut down in their street.

Urban, traffic and agriculture are the three main causes of fine dust

Based on all of this, we can create the concepts of a few personas:

---
Lung patient X
- Can't go outside if there is too much fine dust as it puts too much stress on their lungs
- Likes to take a daily walk
- Would like to determine the best moment to go outside that day

Pregnant woman Y
- Is doing their best to make sure their child is as healthy as possible
- Did research on hidden 'killers' and found ultra fine dust particles and figured that if fine dust is high, ultra fine dust is probably also high
- Wants to know whether it is safe to go grocery shopping.

Child Z
- Likes little things such as bugs and other insects
- Loves to learn things about the small or invisible things that no one notices
- Wants to show everyone this cool app they found

Athlete A
- Is training for an important event and wants ultimate lung capacity
- Loves running outdoors as they can determine their tempo as they go
- Wants to find the best running spot.

Concerned Resident B
- Lives close to a construction site and is afraid for long term exposure to fine dust
- Wants to know whether their symptoms line up with high fine dust
- Wants to see historical data to see whether things got worse before or after / to see if the fine dust is passing the threshhold

Curious C
- Randomly learns about the application and figured they'd give it a try.
- Doesn't know what fine dust is but is interested
- Will probably only use it once
