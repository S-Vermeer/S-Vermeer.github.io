This additional research is a combination of the research that I did, but was less applicable to the project. It
contains research that is 'unofficial', copied things to reference without the official source, I needed to document for
my own but didn't help with the research question etcetera. It can be used as a reference but might contain spelling
errors, be incomplete or simply be a copy and paste without a source.
