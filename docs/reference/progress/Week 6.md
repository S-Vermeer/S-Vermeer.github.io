# Progress Report - Week 6

### General info
**Week**: 6 
**Phase**: 2 - Research and Experiment   
**Contacted**: Frank, Simona  
**Document(s) handed in**: -

##### Biggest accomplishment
I managed to make a Marker-based AR application (in html) for the poster.

##### Biggest setback
The deadline of the poster meant that I spent more time focusing on creating the poster and figuring out things for that than on things such as the EDA which also needs some research still.

### Daily progress

##### Monday
Monday was a day that was filled with other meetings and preparing for those meetings. I started by preparing for a presentation I would be giving for game design students to tell them about the lectorate. After that I had a meeting with a recruiter and a coordinator from the digital forensics team at the police that went extremely well but did take some time. After that I was supposed to do the game design students presentation, but this got moved to Friday. Seeing as I didn't have a lot of time between then and when I had to leave for the different location as I had a training there later, I decided to explore my options for minors some more and have lunch. When I was at the other location I rehearsed my pitch for the training again as I needed to know it by memory at the training.

##### Tuesday
On Tuesday I worked some more on the EDA, defining the data quality and connecting the location of the boxes data to it. I finished a small, incomplete version of a README, just the basics so there was at least something there. Lastly, I started going through all the markdownfiles in git and adjusting any errors.

##### Wednesday
Wednesday was mostly spent working on the design for the poster for the poster market and converting the sketches to figma so they were a bit neater. I also had a meeting with [[22-3-23 Simona]] where we discussed my struggles with AR (she was going to talk with Bert Jan), my poster design, my AR design progress and in general some other aspects of the project such as whether heat sensors were available in Eindhoven. We also discussed that from now on the meetings would be on Wednesday.

##### Thursday
On thursday I worked some more on transferring my sketches to figma and creating an interactive prototype. I also worked on the poster some more, created a marker-based AR application for on the poster as well as a POC for AR, and also created some models for this.

##### Friday
On friday I worked some more on the AR for the poster, printed the poster, had a meeting with Frank just as a check in in general, just to check in not for feedback, and presented to Game Design about the lectorate.
