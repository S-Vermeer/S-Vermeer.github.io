##### Monday
On Monday I worked on trying to get the AI working. It took till 2AM, but eventually it worked. It was a lot of chainreaction errors, where between each push 3 minutes were needed for updating the website, and another 2 to get the results. This meant it took quite a while, especially trying to figure out where the mistake was. I used warnings for this, but I kept forgetting to make the warning a str, as console.log didn't need this.

##### Tuesday
On Tuesday was the IT festival. I was quite early so I could set up my table and make a presentation and ensure everything was working properly. In the afternoon was the AI expo. [23-5-23 IT Event AI Expo]. I also set up the basis for the advice report.

##### Wednesday
On Wednesday I worked on my Advice report, and also updated the feedback report to include the XR event and the IT festival.

##### Thursday
On Thursday I worked on updating my formatting and spellchecking some of my official documents.

##### Friday
On Friday I worked on updating my Software Documentation. I worked on updating some images, documented the future development portion and did some spell checking and formatting.
