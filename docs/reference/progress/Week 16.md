##### Monday
On Monday I worked on updating my research document, while rerunning some EDA cells that were missing but took long to run. I also experimented with showing my EDA in my portfolio.

For the research, I worked on device and browser compatibility in the morning. In the afternoon I also worked on incorporating the conclusions of the feedback report into the verification of the severity research.

##### Tuesday
On Tuesday I mainly worked on the Research document continuing incorporating the conclusions of the feedback report, the conclusions of the EDA and the conclusions of the modelling notebook into the research document. 

##### Wednesday
On Wednesday I worked on spellchecking and formatting fixing the research document. I also worked on clickable links for the sources, however the footnotes took some time to get them to work. I also identified areas that need improving throughout my official documents.

##### Thursday
On Thursday I worked on the last spellchecks and formatting fixes, for example for the portfolio. I had a check in with Frank and told him I'd send the portfolio later that day.

##### Friday
I didn't really do anything on Friday as I needed to wait on Frank to give me feedback, which he didn't have time for till the afternoon.
