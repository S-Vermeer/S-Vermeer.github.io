Eindhoven -> 0 emissiezone?

-> Environmental consequences growing Urban Population. Increase in air temperature (urban heating island (UHI)) and CO2 and air pollutant emissions. Decrease in stored carbon. Threatens ecosystems and mankind. Higher temp -> increase in air pollution bc increased ozone formation and energy demands for cooling 

The ozone target value for the protection of human health (120 μg/m3; maximum daily eight-hour mean), established by the Air Quality Framework Directive, is exceeded 10 to 15 times every year, making O3 one of the most problematic pollutants in the city. As NO2 is one of the precursors to O3, the pair was assessed (the hourly limit-value for NO2 is 200 μg/m3).

Air pollutants affect the entire body, from the beginning of intrauterine development all the way to the end of life, causing premature death mainly through lung and heart disease. An epidemiological study has shown, for example, that mortality rises approximately 7% for every incremental long-term exposure to 5 µg/m3 PM2.5 (95% confidence interval: [2; 13]). Aside from lung and heart disease, the carcinogenic effect of fine dust is now well established. High fine-dust exposure has also been linked to metabolic diseases. For example, in a meta-analysis of cohort studies, the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus was found to be associated with elevated fine dust concentrations, with a 25% relative risk increase [10; 43] for every 10 µg/m3 of PM2.5. More recent studies have shown that these substances cause harm even in concentrations that are below the recommended limits.

-   Fine dust is a mixture of particles <10 µm (0.01 mm) from various sources ([1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6976917/#R1)). Combustion processes in motor vehicles, power plants, heating units, and industrial plants produce particulate matter and gaseous substances (sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides) which are harmful to health in themselves and combine with agricultural ammonia emissions to contribute to secondary fine dust formation ([2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6976917/#R2)). The deleterious effect on health results from chemical and physical properties that produce oxidative stress (on mitochondria, DNA, and proteins) and systemic inflammatory reactions ([3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6976917/#R3)). The harmful effect of fine dust on the lungs and airways is undisputed ([e2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6976917/#E2), [e3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6976917/#E3)) and connections with cardiovascular disease ([4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6976917/#R4), [e2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6976917/#E2), [e4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6976917/#E4)) and some cancers ([e5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6976917/#E5), [e6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6976917/#E6)) is regarded as confirmed. Fine dust of natural origin (soil erosion, pollen, micro-organisms) produce allergic and infectious symptoms. Micro-organisms may, however, also contribute to the natural/healthy human microbiome ([5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6976917/#R5)).
-   Ultrafine particles (<100 nm) play a special role because they penetrate into blood vessels or the autonomous nervous system and may thus even reach the brain. Research is urgently needed, and broad-based routine measurements are lacking.

selected tab not clear
icons on nav

Make sliders the same
make graph bigger

legend bigger
color scale for confidence
labelling icons
All on one page but make it ergonomical, to the bottom
zoom in is nice
nice gif at the front
would like the app on their own phone, interesting concept

make text bigger
look at figma community

Dames

Text bigger, at the bottom of the screen
Like the title
like the minimalistic, simplicity
make it more intuitive (ex. confidence = accuracy)
Make low confidence more prominent
Zoom in on location when tapping on the full screen
add autonomy by allowing settings to edit which sliders you want 
Can barely see smaller particles
Make bullet points for info so it is easier to read
Make visual graph more interactive
add icons to the permissions
add sliders to the permissions
