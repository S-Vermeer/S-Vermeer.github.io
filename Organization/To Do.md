			- [x] Change Introduction name to Abstract
			- [x] Replace Digital Twin City to City Digital Twin
			- [x] 1.3 laatste requirement mag iets helderder, “no prior domain knowledge required, that is the visualized information should be understandable for any user”
			- [x] Als je dat helemaal wil aansluiten op de eerdere verkenning, met name de harde requirements in 1.3, dan zou je de gebruikerservaring en de phone ook in je hoofdvraag kunnen benoemen, en er sub-vragen van kunnen maken.
			- [x] 3.3 je hebt inderdaad geen testopstelling, maar je zal je prototypes hopelijk wel met gebruikers valideren, en je zal je ML modellen testen en tunen. Dit soort dingen horen hier ook bij, geloof ik.
			- [x] 3.4 git repo waar ik als Reporter bij mag
