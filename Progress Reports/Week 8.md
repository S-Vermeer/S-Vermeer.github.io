##### Monday
On Monday I started experimenting more with AR. I have no clue how, but for some reason the code I had at that moment worked relative to the phone instead of GPS based, which is what we wanted. I made the proof of concepts a little more defined.

I figured out that to make the AR/camera not full screen, I would need to use iframes with the AR as a seperate html 'page' embedded in the page. That is why I decided to work on a dynamic design outline based on the validated designs  where I could then incorporate the AR component. I managed to get a reusable header and footer, but I got stuck on highlighting the page someone is on, as I couldn't get JQuery to work.

I also met with Sabina, an old coach of mine and Veronica, a student who was interested in joining the lectorate for an internship and wanted to know more about it.
