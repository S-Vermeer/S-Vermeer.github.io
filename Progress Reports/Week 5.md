# Progress Report - Week 5

### General info
**Week**: 5
**Phase**: 2 - Research and Experiment  
**Contacted**: Frank, Simona  
**Document(s) handed in**: -

##### Biggest accomplishment
I finally have all the data, which means I can start researching AI, and I have created a system with tasks that works for me.

##### Biggest setback
It is proving to be very difficult to get AR in something that is accessible to our users. I can't get location-based AR to work on html (AR.js), I can get it to work on Unity but I would prefer it if I could make a React app with Unity integrated so I only have to do the AR in Unity instead of an entire app.

### Daily progress

##### Monday
Monday I was waiting for the API to get back up again to finish the last little bit of data acquisition. However, this took longer than I thought and had hoped and meanwhile I couldn't do anything as that last branch was quite far away from the last main commit. 

However, I did want to have a more visual to do list, so I started exploring how to do this in Gitkraken, however this functionality was removed at the start of this year. Then I tried to do it in Gitlab, however, removing an issue was difficult and more importantly, I wanted to use multiple boards which seemed possible, but turned out wasn't in a free membership, only multiple duplicates of the same board. Eventually, I ended up with Trello, where I can have 10 boards for free, can add checklist and also for example sort by labels so I only see the tasks that are important at that moment. Aside from some general labels such as the topic and type of task, I also added labels that were applied if a task was waiting on another task, if another task was waiting on this task and a high priority task label.

At the end of the day, the API was finally up again and was able to finish collecting the last bit of data and during the night the data was combined into a single dataframe. 

##### Tuesday
On Tuesday I finished up saving the different dataframes and started exploring them a little. I also started sketching a few possible designs for the application. 

##### Wednesday
On Wednesday I started with updating my EDA layout and adding Data Sourcing. After that it was time for the Knowledge Sharing session. After the knowledge sharing session I ate my lunch and the meeting with [[15-3-2023 Frank]] that was planned for somewhere after 13.30 was moved up, so I met with Frank. After that I started helping out Tessa, as she was struggling with her project as the person who worked on it previously made quite a bit of errors in the project and Tessa didn't know how to fix it. Once Simona was done with her previous meeting, I also met with [[15-3-2023 Simona]], as she wasn't here tomorrow. After that I continued helping Tessa with her project.

##### Thursday
On Thursday I started the day by updating things such as my progress report and helping Tessa solve the problem that we were working on yesterday. After that I worked a little bit on my EDA, cleaning it a little bit and adding some more explanations as well as verifying whether the units were all the same and when the data started recording. After that I started incorporating the expert interview ([[Jean-Paul 7-3-23]]) into my fine dust research.

##### Friday
On Friday I tried to implement Unity with React, but so far, no progress. I am having trouble with a combination of dependencies being outdated and referencing in gradle to my unity project. It is not that I am not making progress at all, but so far I don't have anything that works yet and though it should, I don't know whether it *will* work.
