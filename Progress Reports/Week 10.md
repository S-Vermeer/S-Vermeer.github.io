##### Monday
On Monday I tried to get requests to the API working by trying to execute python in javascript and though I got it to work to run python in javascript, the errors from the requests module still existed so this was still not an option. Though it should allow GET requests, CORS is still not allowing me to request to the API. So I tried to see whether I could figure out how to do it from the original javascript approach. So far without success. I also started on documenting my experimenting and research on CORS.

##### Tuesday
On tuesday I continued experimenting with CORS and after documenting some more and finding out that it could only be fixed by indirectly requesting the API through our own API, a proxy or such or by asking the creator to alter the API, I decided to create my own API. It was already quite clear at the start that to connect the AI model and the front-end I was going to need to make an API, but I hadn't started yet. Seeing as in my research on CORS I saw flash coming by a lot with ways to resolve CORS errors, and I looked into it and it looked simple enough, I decided to try and see whether I could get a simple API set up using Flask.
