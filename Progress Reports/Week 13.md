##### Monday
On Monday I worked on getting the weather data for using polynomial features to see whether that would produce a better model. I also tried out predicting the next 12 hours to see if that would produce better models. At first I wanted to look for an API for weather data, but then I remembered that in a previous project we also used hourly weather data for Eindhoven, so I found the updated version of that from the KNMI and worked on selecting and combining the relevant data of that so I could test it before working on combining it with an API, and perhaps even paying for an account for something that doesn't even work.
