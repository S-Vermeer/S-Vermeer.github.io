##### Monday
On Monday I worked on getting the weather data for using polynomial features to see whether that would produce a better model. I also tried out predicting the next 12 hours to see if that would produce better models. At first I wanted to look for an API for weather data, but then I remembered that in a previous project we also used hourly weather data for Eindhoven, so I found the updated version of that from the KNMI and worked on selecting and combining the relevant data of that so I could test it before working on combining it with an API, and perhaps even paying for an account for something that doesn't even work. I also updated the Prophet model to include the weather data as that model also allowed for it.

##### Tuesday
On Tuesday I moved the weather data a bit up so it could be reached by the other chapters as well, which took some time. I also mainly worked on my Software Architecture document, the Data Storage and Choices, and the CI/CD pipeline and repositories.
