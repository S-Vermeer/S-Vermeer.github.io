##### Monday
Second Easter day

##### Tuesday
On Tuesday I started by working on some 3D models in blender that might be used for the AR application to make it more realistic and immersive. After that I got a message from Simona with a report about my data and that we would discuss it that afternoon so I started reading through that and noting down possible aspects I could compare with my scraping of the data.

In the afternoon I also had a meeting with Simona and Jean-Paul. Jean-Paul was not aware of the inconsistencies between the data and the report. That is why we are now contacting someone else. 

##### Wednesday
On Wednesday I worked a little bit on implementing the models into the AR application, I had my 'comeback day' presentation and had a knowledge sharing session. In the afternoon was the career day where I was representing the Lectorate together with Teague, Dennis and Tessa.

##### Thursday
On thursday I got to working on trying to interact between the slider in the AR page and the animation in the Aframe, I also got back my feedback form from Simona with extremely positive feedback. 

##### Friday
