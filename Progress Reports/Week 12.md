##### Monday
During the holiday I worked a bit on the meeting wtih TNO, a little bit of modelling so it could run in the background and I worked a bit on documenting my research on the weight of fine dust particles. However, I knew that my feedback was mainly to take breaks so I decided to spent the majority of my holiday as the free days I was entitled to by my contract.

On Monday I had the meeting with TNO at 13.00, and had to apply for my minor at 9.00. Between that, stressing about suddenly having to contact the exam commission and travelling times I did not have a lot of room to work on the project. I did update my planning a bit so I knew what to do as soon as I could start working again.
