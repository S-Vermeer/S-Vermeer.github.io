# Progress Report - Week 4

### General info
**Week**: 4  
**Phase**: 2 - Research and Experiment
**Contacted**: Simona, Jean-Paul
**Document(s) handed in**: -  

##### Biggest accomplishment
I managed to get a little bit of AR working in Unity, which is more than I was able to for AR.js in React.

##### Biggest setback
Jean-Paul had a lot of insights, however they did not make things easier for me. For example he mentioned how fine dust wasn't really able to be predicted and how between the sensor and 1 meter from the sensor there was a world of difference in the amount of fine dust particles. So that forced me to choose between making the solution fit the problem and fit the requests of the stakeholder and scope.

##### Monday
Though a lot of data has been collected during the weekend, one of the locations is longer than the rest of them, and started collecting in 2015. This is good for some aspects, but as the API stopped working during the collection, the collecting needs to restart for that location and still start for the last 2 locations. This means that we still do not have all the data. Luckily we got the AR research so we can continue with that while we wait until we can combine all the data into one. I worked on AR techniques and spent the majority of my time on that.

##### Tuesday
On Tuesday I researched AR Frameworks and I also started experimenting with my protoype for AR. I am having a lot of difficulty with it as I am using react but my application is based around web and requires https so I am trying to see whether the react aspect is the problem with showing the camera or that I am missing something. I also experimented with using Unity as it provides integration with React and AR possibilities, however so far I was unable to run something as the demos and tutorials kept throwing errors.

During the evening, around 10PM my expert, Jean-Paul emailed me asking whether I had time the next day at noon. Though my stakeholder had requested to be apart of it if possible, as I didn't know what the other options in my experts schedule were I decided to take the opportunity. However, I had not yet prepared my interview so I decided to do that based on the questions done in the pre-interview through email.

##### Wednesday
Wednesday was full of meetings and a little bit of augmented reality. I kept on experimenting with Unity to see whether I could get AR to work that way, as I saw that you are able to integrate Unity into React and AR.JS / AFrame was giving me some difficulties. I was able to get a camera working and something to show up, however it was meant to move with where the camera was pointing which did not work. After that I had a knowledge sharing session, a meeting with [[Jean-Paul 7-3-23]] and a training on Networking and LinkedIn.  The meeting with Jean-Paul was very insightful, however did bring a lot of questions for Simona as to how to approach the project.

##### Thursday
On Thursday I continued working on AR in Unity, and after a little bit of troubleshooting, I figured out how to get back on track with the tutorial and have a camera and something that moves to where the camera points. 

Then it was time for the meeting with [[9-3-23 Simona]]. We discussed some of my questions and concerns, for example about Unity and AR.js, the information that Jean-Paul had shared and how to incorporate it without completely changing the project etc. She also mentioned that she was impressed with what I was doing so far, that I would be able to handle challenges but that I don't have to make it too challenging for myself. That is why she said to first get a basis set up and then expand with more challenging parts. She also mentioned that she had talked to Bart, who had mentioned that I was working very hard but that he was afraid that I was going too fast for my own good. 

After that meeting I had a meeting about organizing the [[Postermarkt]]. The leftover time, I spent working on transferring the AR Unity prototyping to my git repository. I did this in a seperate branch, as this is based on a tutorial and the majority of assets are not relevant to our project, so I did not want to combine it just yet until I had figured out what would be a good way to do it.

##### Friday
On Friday I mostly spent time working on preparing for the Poster Market so the information I could already fill in was filled in and I had better insights in what it would entail. I also updated my [[Research Document]] as something went wrong on a commit so it lost a version.
