## The Assignment
### Context
The Lectorate ‘High Tech Embedded Software’ from Fontys HBO ICT researches methods and techniques to enhance software development for smart high-tech embedded systems.

The project will be concerning the Digital Twin Academy, City Digital Twin specifically, which conducts case studies on digital twins to enrich open data of air quality with public area info and other data sources to define useful eco-score. 

#### Problem
One of the biggest problems with the most wicked city problems like air pollution or biodiversity loss is that people are not aware of their seriousness, which is why the City Digital Twin project wants to make this more tangible.

#### Goals
The goal of this project is to make the seriousness of the most wicked city problems more tangible.  The desired product is an application that uses Augmented Reality to visualize location-based data in such a way that it is understandable to the people at that location.

It is possible to make Digital Twins of cities for specific contexts and goals. One of these is informative visualizations, which is what our project consists of. This project should both work towards its goal of making an informative visualization of city problems, as well as be useful for future City Digital Twin projects.

## Process and Results
Assessment of the different dimensions of the HBO-i Matrix. For each dimension, the (sub)products that fit the criteria are described, along with why they fit and where they can be found.

#### Analysis
##### Project Plan
The [[Project Plan]] was made based on the [[Project Proposal]]. This document details what the internship will entail. In this, the context, problems and challenges are analysed and defined as well as a global planning and time indication.

##### Research Document
In the [[Research Document]], research questions 1.1 and 1.2 give an analysis of the city problems that are being monitored and their impacts based on a literature study and expert interview. Research question 2.2 gives an analysis of different Augmented Reality techniques and frameworks based on a literature study. Research questions 3.1 and 3.2 give an analysis of the data used using Data Analytics, as supported by the {Exploratory Data Analysis}. 3.2 also gives an analysis of possible machine learning predictions that can be made based on this data. Research question 4.1 provides an analysis of the devices that this project is supported on. Research question 4.2 analyses the user and their behaviours regarding the application.

#### Advise
##### Project Plan
In the [[Project Plan]] chapter two, the approach, research methods and a breakdown of the project and its planning are described. These advices on how to proceed with the project were also provided with feedback, improved and then approved by both the internship coach and the company coach. 

##### Research Document
In the [[Research Document]] the conclusion of Chapter 1, City Problems, provides advice on which city problem to continue with. This was based on the research in research questions 1.1 and 1.2, a SWOT analysis and a discussion with my company coach. In the conclusion of Chapter 2, Augmented Reality, advice is given on which augmented reality techniques best fit the assignment. This is based on the requirements and limitations of the project and some prototyping which can be found in the {Code repository}. Research question 3.2 provides advice on which predictions are possible and should be developed further. Research question 4.1 advises on the support range of the application on devices.

#### Design
##### Research Document
In the [[Research Document]], question 2.1 details the process of designing the application through sketching, clickable wireframes and user feedback. This is also supported by the [[Feedback report]], which goes more in-depth on how the feedback was obtained. 

#### Realization
##### Research Document
In the [[Research Document]], question 3.2 references the machine-learning algorithm that was developed based on the advice in the same section. The code on which the algorithm is based, and which is referenced can be found in the {Code Reference}. Question 4.2 references the realized application, the code for which can also be found in the {Code Reference}.
